My favorite language is C#  due to how much you can do with it (and how you don't need to sign in to Oracle to get a JDK).

My love/hate language is Batchfile (Command Prompt code). It's really annoying to make scripts for it, but when you do, you get this giant relief.

If you have any problems, message me on Steam or DM me on Nexus Mods. Reddit, Roblox, and Discord aren't available since my Discord is friends-only, Roblox is ####, and Reddit is, well, Reddit.
